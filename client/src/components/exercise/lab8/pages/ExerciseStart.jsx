            live stream, the streamer for which has recently taken a break and
            is away from their computer. You are testing a new moderation tool

            inappropriate.{" "}

              Your task is to monitor the live chat and either keep or remove
              messages based on their level of appropriateness. You should take
              the AIâ€™s recommendation into consideration for each message.
