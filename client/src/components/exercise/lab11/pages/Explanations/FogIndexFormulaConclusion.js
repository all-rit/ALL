          The Fog Index of the email was 20.86, which is the equivalent of a
          post-graduate reading level. Since this email is intended for students
          and families of students, the Fog Index shouldnâ€™t be higher than 10,
          or the reading level of a high school sophomore. To repair the
          readability of the email, you will choose one of the emails on the
          following page with a Fog Index of 10 or less.
