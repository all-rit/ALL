          Great work, you implemented all 3 parts of the fog index formula, and
          the fog index widget now displays the correct fog index!

          The fog index of the email was 20.865, which is the equivalent of a
          post-graduate reading level. Since this email is intended for students
          and families of students, the fog index shouldnâ€™t be higher than 10,
          or the reading level of a high school sophomore. To repair the
          readability of the email, you will choose one of the emails on the
          following page with a fog index of 10 or less.
