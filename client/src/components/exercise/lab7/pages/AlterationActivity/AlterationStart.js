                In machine learning, a <b>utility equation</b> is used to assign
                values to certain actions that the AI system can take. A
                simplified version of a utility equation can be written as:
              </p>
              <MathComponent
                tex={String.raw`Utility = \frac{Reward\;Value}{Cost\;Value}`}

                The goal of a <b>utility equation</b> is to get more reward,
                despite the cost or higher utility.

              be given the original utility equation that was provided and a new
              equation. You will then be asked to compare them and their impact
              on the autonomous system.
