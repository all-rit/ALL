      <h3 className="center">Four Main Types of Color Vision Deficiencies</h3>
      <ul className="study__list">
        <li>
          <h3>Protanomaly (proht-n-om-uh-lee):</h3>
          <p className="center">
            There is a reduced sensitivity to red light. Most people with this
            have issues distinguishing between reds, greens, browns, and
            oranges. There can also be confusion when comparing blues and
            purples to one another. This is one of the most common forms of a
            CDV.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Deuteranomaly (deu-ter-​anom-a-ly):</h3>
          <p className="center">
            There is a reduced sensitivity to green light. Most people with this
            also have issues distinguishing between reds, greens, browns, and
            oranges. They can also confuse blues and purples when copmpared to
            one another. This is the other most common form of a CVD.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Tritanomaly (trī′tə-nŏm′ə-lē):</h3>
          <p className="center">
            There is a reduced sensitivity to blue light. Most people with this
            have issues distinguishing between blue and yellow, violet and red,
            and blue and green. Most of the colors someone with this would see
            are pink, red, black, white, grey, and turquoise. This CVD is
            extremely rare.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Monochromacy (mon-o-chro-ma-cy):</h3>
          <p className="center">
            Individuals with this deficiency can see no colors at all.
            Everything is a shade of grey that ranges between white and black.
            This is incredibly rare (approximately 1 in 33,000 people are
            diagnosed with this condition). Due to the range of colors these
            individuals can see, it can make it difficult to perform even
            everyday tasks.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="center">
        Each form of CVD has varying levels of severity.

        <h3 className="center">
          What, in the eye, is causing colors to be perceived in this way?
        </h3>
        <p className="center">
          For individuals with Protanomaly, Deuteranomaly, and Tritanomaly, they
          are considered dichromatic, meaning that they only have two types of
          cones in their eyes to perceived colors. People without these
          deficiencies have three cones and each cone is responsible for
          perceiving red, green, and blue. This is where the reduced sensitivity
          comes from, as the reduction in one cone causes a section of the color
          spectrum to not be viewable to the individual. This section happens to
          overlap for individuals with Protanomaly and Deuteranomaly, which is
          why some individuals may refer to their deficiency as 'red/green
          colorblindness', as these individuals may tend to see the world in
          very similar ways.

        <h3 className="center">Causes of color vision deficiencies:</h3>
        <p className="center">
          Color vision deficiencies are normally caused by genetic conditions
          and are usually inheritied from an individual's parents. Men are more
          often impacted than women because the gene is carried in the X
          chromosome. There can be some other cases that cause color vision
          deficiencies however their causes are still being researched to
          determine the exact cause.

      <h4 className="center">
        At this moment in time, there is no cure to these deficiencies.
