      <h3>Accessibility Standards</h3>

      <p>
        In order to establish accessibility standards throughout government-run

        ensure individuals with hearing loss can properly identify prominent
        information in studentâ€™s web applications moving forward.

      <h3>NAD vs Netflix Lawsuit</h3>

      <p>
        In 2011, the National Association of the Deaf (NAD) filed a{" "}
        <a
          href="https://www.3playmedia.com/2015/07/23/nad-v-netflix-ada-lawsuit-requires-closed-captioning-on-streaming-video/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          lawsuit
        </a>{" "}
        against Netflix due to the lack of closed captioning in their streaming
        videos, which is considered as a violation of the ADA. More than half of
        all Americans use Netflix. Thus it must be made accessible to Deaf and
        Hard of Hearing viewers. Netflix argues that the ADA only specified that
        "places of public accommodation" must be accessible to people with
        disabilities and its business cannot be considered a "place of public
        accommodation" since it is not a physical place. Hence, Netflix is not
        subject to the ADA. NAD argued that the Internet is not exempt from the
        ADA, and Netflix is considered a shared or public activity, which makes
        the ADA applicable. The judge ruled in favor of the NAD's argument.
        Thus, Netflix had to add subtitles for their streaming videos (shown in
        Figure 1) to make their website accessible for Deaf and Hard of Hearing
        users.
