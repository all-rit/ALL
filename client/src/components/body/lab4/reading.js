      <h3>What Is a Dexterity Impairment?</h3>
      <p>
        Many types of dexterity impairments exist, but all limit the
        functionality of one or more limbs and cause the loss of fine control of
        movement. They can be caused by an injury, a genetic disorder, or a
        disease. For example, Muscular dystrophy is a genetic disorder that
        causes progressive weakness in the muscles.
      </p>

      <h3>Examples of Dexterity Impairments</h3>
      <p>
        <ul className="study__list">
          <li>Spinal cord injury</li>
          <li>Loss or damage of limb</li>
          <li>Cerebral palsy</li>
          <li>Muscular dystrophy</li>
          <li>Multiple sclerosis</li>
          <li>Spina bifida</li>
          <li>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)</li>

      <h3>Effects of Dexterity Impairments on Software Usage</h3>
      <p>
        Dexterity impairments can make it difficult to use traditional
        technologies such as a keyboard or mouse. To combat these challenges,
        people with dexterity impairments can use various assistive
        technologies. For example, voice-activated technologies can be used to
        browse the web with only voice commands. Other technologies include
        keyboard-only navigation, alternative keyboards, switch devices, and
        on-screen keyboard programs. It is important to be aware that some users
        may become fatigued from using assistive technologies.
      </p>

      <h3>Accessibility Standards for Dexterity Impairment</h3>
      <p>
        The W3C organization makes several suggestions for making software
        accessible to users with dexterity impairments. One guideline is to
        ensure that all features can be accessed via a keyboard. In addition,
        another guideline is to make all touch targets (for example, a button)
        at least 9mm high by 9mm wide.
