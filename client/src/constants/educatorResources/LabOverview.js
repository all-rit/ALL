      "Each of our labs follows a consistent workflow, starting with an 'About' section that provides a brief introduction to the topic. From there, participants delve into an informative Reading section, which covers essential concepts like Color Blindness or AI biases. After absorbing key information, participants engage with an interactive exercise designed to both educate and foster empathy for those affected by the topic. Following the exercise, participants watch 2-3 videos in the Reinforcement section to reinforce their understanding. The lab concludes with a quiz to test their newfound knowledge. Below are detailed descriptions of each section.",

    description:
      "The Exercise section is the heart of the lab, offering a hands-on interactive scenario where participants confront accessibility challenges or poorly trained AI/ML models. Participants are tasked with 'repairing' these components using JavaScript in our custom code editor. Once corrected, they can reattempt the task using the repaired component, gaining both practical skills and a deeper understanding of the topic.",
